# Experiments for minimization on 15-node chain with loops

## chain topology

The chain topology contains 15 nodes. It contains 80% variable nodes and a single loop consists of 4 variables.

## Experiments

`exp_minimization_BDD.py` runs minimization experiment for BDD version.

`exp_minimization_Z3.py` runs minimization experiment for Z3 version.
