# Real Conditions

## 3 cases of conditions

Note: each row in files represents one condition.

`contradiction.txt` stores the contradictory conditions.

`satisfiable.txt` stores the conditions who are satisfiable.

`tautopology.txt` stores the tautological conditions.

## Two tables conditions

`get_toy_conditions.py` is used to generating the conditions.

`table1.txt` stores the conditions for table R12. R12 is generated by executing SQL: `select 1, t2.n2 as n2 from T_prime t1, T_prime t2 where t1.n1 = '1' and t1.n2 = t2.n1 and t2.n1 = t2.n2` and then merging tuples.

`table2.txt` stores the conditions for table R34. R34 is generated by executing SQL: `select t1.n1 as n1, t2.n2 as n2 from T_prime t1, T_prime t2 where t1.n2 = t2.n1 and t2.n1 = t2.n2` and then merging tuples.

`table1_join_table2.txt` stores the conditions for table R14. R14 is generated by joining R12 and R34. The SQL is `select 1, t2.n2 as n2 from r1_2 t1, r3_4 t2 where t1.n2 = t2.n1`.


**Note: We did not check for the tautology after merging tuples. Therefore, the condition in `table1_join_table2.txt` might be a tautology or a satisfactory.**
