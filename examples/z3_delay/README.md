# Experiment for Z3 delay

# Topology

Generate chain topology with 3 summary nodes and only 1 loop which consists of all variable nodes. 

# Plan

To see the z3 delay, we increase the total number of chain topology, but fix the number of summary nodes, thus the variable nodes are increasing in the loop.
