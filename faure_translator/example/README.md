* `exp_closure.py` is used to calculate the closure groups for a generated chain with specified size, then stores the chain in the `data/chain#.json`, # represents the number of size, and records the running time for calculating closure groups  into `data/exp_close_data.txt`.
* `exp_faure_closure.py` is used to do the experiments with the faure evaluation after closure group. It records the groups, length of each group, average execution time of three steps and average execution time of finishing all groups. They are stored into `data/exp_faure_close_data.txt`.
* `exp_faure_closure.log` is log file of my past experiment but only run once for each group. Just take a look at the process of `exp_faure_closure.py`.

## Usage

### `exp_closure.py`

The current `exp_closure.py` only generates the chain with 100 nodes. You could modify size list to generate the different sizes of chain.

```python
sizes = [100] # modify the size here
rate = 0.2 # the rate of overlay nodes

f = open("data/exp_close_data.txt", "a") # modify the locatioin of output here.
...
```

### `exp_faure_closure.py`

The current `exp_faure_closure.py` runs the expeiment for all closure groups that calculated from the chain generated by `exp_closure.py`. The example here is only the chain with 100 nodes.

```python
sizes = [100] # modify the size here
rate = 0.2 # the rate of overlay nodes

for size in sizes:
    f = open("data/exp_faure_close_data{}.txt".format(size), "a") # modify the locatioin of output here.
    ...
```
