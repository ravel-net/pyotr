1. Install the following packages:

pip3 install psycopg2-binary
pip3  install z3-solver
pip3 install tqdm
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
pip3 install tk
pip3 install python-igraph

Note that depending on your machine, you might need to install more/different packages. 

2. Install PostgreSQL (tested on version 9 and 13 but will likely work on other versions).

3. Create a test database e.g. 'create database test' in PostgreSQL cli.

4. Add host ip, username, password, and the name of the test database in "databaseconfig.py". This configuration file is used in Pyotr for database operations.
